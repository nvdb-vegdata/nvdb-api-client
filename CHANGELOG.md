  When NVDB API LES V3 has a different version of Datakatalogen than the version in this header 
  `HTTP 422: Nåværende datakatalogversjon i APIet er: {new version}` is returned.
* It is possible to define a callback for `RoadObjectClient` that is called when Datakatalog version changes.
  ```
  java
    clientFactory.createRoadObjectClient(
      DatakatalogPolicy.builder()
      .onDatakatalogUpdateCallback(() -> { /* do something */})    
      .build()
